# Cpp_Connected_Component_Labelling-K-Means_Clustering-Dice_Coefficients-RLC
The following codes are for image processing in C++ which includes Connected Components labelling of images, their K-means Clustering, their dice coefficients as well as RLC of images all to detect lessions in Dermascopy.
In order to run the following code please first install the openCV package and include that library in your C++ IDE, the follwoing youtube can help you in that:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trXs2r6xSnI&t=2s.
The images that you can use for the following code are also provided so feel free to test my code on them.
For the components labelings use the segmented output images and add the path to those in the fil variable, do the same for for Kmeans where you use original images and in RLC you use segmented outputs for the dice components you already have task1 and task2 .h files to compare the dice coeffcients values to.
